Some years ago I switched from **Windows 10** to **Ubuntu** as an operative system for my laptop which has been my loyal companion for more than 6 years. It was fun. Of course, switching to a Linux Distro coming from Windows can be a little tricky at the begining, but it's just a matter of getting used to it. Soon I discovered that I felt more comfortable using it. 

# The origins: Ubuntu

I think Ubuntu has been my first contact with Linux. Of course, before installing it in my laptop, I remember trying it when I was a kid in an old desktop computer I inherited from some family member and I decided to install it to it just for fun. Also, during my Bachelor's, I also tried other Linux distributions, either because there were installed on the school's machines or because I needed to use some tool only available in Linux. For the latest case, I would install a VM or install Ubuntu in a partition.

After all that, I would say four years ago, I decided to wipe the disk and just install Ubuntu. I would say the main reason was because it run out of space and I was not using Windows anymore. 

## GNOME

My curiosity awakaned when one day I saw one of my friend's laptop. He had some UI widgets that looked very cool. He told me he was using **GNOME** as a Desktop Environment and I pretended to undersand what he said. :sweat_smile: 



# I use Arch btw

I think it was around 2-3 months ago (February 2020), while studying for my MS.c exams, that a friend and I decided to spend our time installing Arch instead of studying.
