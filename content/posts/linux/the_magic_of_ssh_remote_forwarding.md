These past days I've been setting up a Raspberry Pi running some services in my room. I wanted to access them from outside the house's network but unfortunately, I don't have access to the router.

I could have set up a VPN client into the Pi but it is running a very minimal OS to which I cannot install packages.

Fortunately, SSH has an option for **Remote port forwarding** which allowed me to solve this problem.

# Local port forwarding

SSH Local port forwarding allows us to redirect queries from `localhost:sourcePort` to `remotehost:onPort`. It is specified in the following way:

```bash
ssh -L [bind_address:]sourcePort:remotehost:onPort gateway
```

- `gateway`: The SSH connection will be open to that machine
- `remotehost:onPort`: `gateway` will connect to `remotehost:onPort`
- `sourcePort`: SSH will redirect our requests to `sourcePort` to `remotehost:onPort` through `gateway`
- `bind_address`: It may be used to bind the connection to a specific address. For example, *localhost* indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only

# Remote port forwarding

SSH Remote port forwarding allows us to forward all connection attempts to `sourcePort` to `remotehost:onPort` through `gateway`.

```bash
ssh -R [bind_address:]sourcePort:remotehost:onPort gateway
```

The parameters behave the same as in *Local port forwarding.*

There is an excellent answer in Stackoverflow [[2]] where the **difference between local and remote** port forwarding are explained.

# My setup

For my particular use case, the remote Raspberry Pi (*RASPBERRY PI BEHIND ROUTER*) executes the following loop after booting up:

```bash
while true; do
ssh -N -o ServerAliveInterval=10 -R 2222:localhost:22 pi@RASPBERRY_PI_OPEN
done &
```

As you may know by now, this SSH command opens a connection to my Raspberry Pi with some ports open globally (*RASPBERRY PI OPEN*). The SSH command is wrapped with a `while true` to start a new session if it dies.

Now, from *RASPBERRY PI OPEN* I can open an SSH connection to *RASPBERRY PI BEHIND ROUTER* using the following command:

```bash
ssh -l user -p 2222 localhost -L 8000:localhost:80
```

Besides, I redirect with *Local port forwarding* the port 80 of *RASPBERRY PI BEHIND ROUTER* to port 8000 of *RASPBERRY PI OPEN* so I can access a service running on that port.

The only remaining thing is connecting from my *LAPTOP*. For this, I also use *Local port forwarding* to redirect port 8000.

```bash
ssh RASPBERRY_PI_OPEN -L 8000:localhost:8000
```
