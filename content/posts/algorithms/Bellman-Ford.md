Each post of this series will have the following structure:

# Introduction

In this post I'm going to explain the Bellman-Ford algorithm. In human words, the Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest paths between a given **source** and all the destinations. This is exactly the same as **Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm**, but **BF** can work in graphs that contain negative weights.
